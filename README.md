Stopwatch Web Application ⏱️

Description
This is a fully functional Stopwatch Web Application built as part of my internship at ProdigyInfoTech. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a minimalist design with essential functionalities like start, pause, reset, and lap recording. The application is also responsive, ensuring it works well across various device sizes.
